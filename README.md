# GotX

Gotx的中文文档可以从[这里](https://www.jianshu.com/p/d429a3aa0b1c)看起。

A Golang interpreter based on [Yaegi](https://github.com/containous/yaegi).

Directly run Golang-like code files. Almost the same syntax as Golang. Installation of Golang is not required to run GotX code, it's convenient especially for running/debugging on remote servers.

Most of the standard libraries and some useful 3rd-party libraries are included.

Support GUI programming with OpenGL or LCL library.

A command-line only version (GotXc) is also available.

Currently supported 3rd-party libraies: github.com/topxeq/tk, github.com/topxeq/sqltk, github.com/beevik/etree, github.com/AllenDang/giu.

If more packages are required, please compile the source code, add the packages you need, refer to the examples of the packages already supported.
